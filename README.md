# **Ashley’s Social Link Tree** 🌳✨  
**Welcome!** This is not just any link tree—it's *the* link tree. It’s where you’ll find Ashley Willis on the internet, curated with love, humor, and a hint of snark.  

---

## **Why Does This Exist?**  
Because even the most legendary developer advocates need a central hub to keep track of their internet kingdom. From Bluesky to GitHub (and yes, even *that site* we don’t talk about anymore 👀), this site has it all.  

---

## **Features**  
🌈 **Eye Candy**: A gradient background so good it might just inspire your next side project.  

💡 **React-powered Magic**: Built with React, because why not over-engineer a simple page?  

🔥 **Stylish Links**: Every button is dressed to impress, complete with hover effects that scream, "Click me!"  

☕️ **Built with Love**: And just a splash of caffeine-induced creativity.  

---

## **Quick Setup**  
1. Clone this repository like a technologist:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/ashley-social.git
   cd ashley-social
   ```
2. Open `index.template.html` in your browser. Marvel at its brilliance.  
3. No npm install or build scripts. Just plain ol’ HTML/CSS/JS goodness.

ß
## **Tech Stack**
